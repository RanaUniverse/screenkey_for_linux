This is the files i need to install for working with git in terminal.
This is same as running the below command in online computer:

	sudo apt install screenkey


To download these i used this process below:


sudo apt-get install --print-uris --yes screenkey | grep ^\' | cut -d\' -f2 > packages.txt
mkdir dependencies_for_screenkey
cd dependencies_for_screenkey
wget -i ../packages.txt


* Then i will run the installation_scripts.sh which will just install the packages.
